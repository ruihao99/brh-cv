## Academic Experience

(Graduate Research)

### Spin-lattice relaxation with non-linear couplings: Comparison between Fermi's golden rule and extended dissipaton equation of motion
May. 2022 - Aug. 2026

Supervisor: Prof. Wenjie Dou, Westlake University. [Group Page](https://dougroup.westlake.edu.cn/index.html)

- (done) Derived the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) for a two-level spin-lattice relaxation model with both linear and non-linear couplings. 
  
- (done) Compared the FGR results with the extended dissipaton equation of motion for the same model, indicating the overestimation of the FGR for the relaxation rate in the strong coupling, high temperature regime.

- (on-going, collaboration) Using the FGR and extended dissipaton equation of motion to fit the experimental spin-lattice relaxation data.
